## Our Core Research Areas

### 1. Emerging Memristive Devices
We investigate novel memory devices including **RRAM**, **CBRAM**, and **2D ferroelectric devices**. Our goal is to achieve high density, low power consumption, and CMOS-process compatibility.

### 2. Neuromorphic Computing and In-Memory Computing
We design hardware systems that mimic the human brain for efficient AI tasks. This includes implementing synapses and neurons with memristive devices to break the von Neumann bottleneck.

### 3. 55nm CMOS Manufacturing Process and Device Development
At the Zhejiang CMOS Innovation Platform, we work on the reliability of 55nm technology nodes and the development of embedded non-volatile memory (eFlash).
